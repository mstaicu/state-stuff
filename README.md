# The simplest state management library ever

üçã A short and concise state management done in Javascript

## Installation

1. Make sure you have npm installed
2. 'npm install' will fetch the required dependencies

## Usage

To run the build issue 'npm run build'. It will run the code coverage and testing reports prior to building the library for UMD, which makes it available for client-side usage and node.js.

If you want to run just the tests, run 'npm run tests'.

Also, this library is ready to be released on npm. Make sure you sync this fork with Travis CI. With each commit, Semantic Release will make sure it releases the appropriate SemVer version based on the list of commits that happen before the last SemVer release. This means it could release a major, minor or patch version of the library. üí™
